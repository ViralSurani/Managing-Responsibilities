Mixin Class Defined
"A mixin class is a class that's intended to provide an optional interface
or functionality to other classes. It's similar to an abstract class in that it's not
intended to be instantiated. Mixin classes require multiple inheritance."
Gamma et al., Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

Mixins in .NET
-.NET languages do not support multiple class inheritance
  Mixin can be an interface
- A class can implement interfaces even when it has a base class
  Existing class can also be an interface
  
Is Mixin a Pattern?
-"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again
  in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
  in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over,
  without ever doing it the same way twice."
  Alexander et al., A Pattern Language
  
-Is Mixin a Pattern?
 Does the language support Mixins natively?
- Common Lisp has an idiomatic implementation of Mixins
- C++ supports multiple class inheritance
 Mixins in C#
- Not supported out of the box
- Used in a way characteristic to patterns

Implementing Mixins in C#
 Aspect-oriented frameworks
- Intention to mix interfaces is expressed using attributes
• Beware of strange solutions in these frameworks
- Frameworks add complexity to the project
• Make sure that added complexity pays off
 Using extension methods
- New method is added to the original class
- Extension method acts as any other method defined on the class
• Extension method can only see public members of the class
 The goal of this module
- Implement a simple solution
- Intentions must be clearly indicated in code
