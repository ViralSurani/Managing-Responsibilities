ï‚§ Lets us add operations to existing hierarchy of classes
- Existing classes do not have to be modified to support new visitor
- Visitor must provide one method for every member of the class hierarchy
- Adding new class to the hierarchy causes all visitors to change

Note on hierarchical and linear data structures
- It is not mandatory to have such data structure
- Visitor design pattern is applicable to any data structure
