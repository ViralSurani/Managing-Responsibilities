 Lets us add operations to existing hierarchy of classes
- Existing classes do not have to be modified to support new visitor
- Visitor must provide one method for every member of the class hierarchy
- Adding new class to the hierarchy causes all visitors to change

Note on hierarchical and linear data structures
- It is not mandatory to have such data structure
- Visitor design pattern is applicable to any data structure

SUMMARY
 Visitor design pattern and encapsulation
- It is possible to apply the visitor even when object encapsulates its data
- Visitor can receive raw data
- No need to expose public accessors on the visited object

 Visitor objects are typically stateful
- New instance of the visitor must be passed to Accept every time

 Visitors often used as part of the result which produces result
- Visitor could be designed to produce concrete result
- This will be addressed in the next module

 Order of invocations
- Never assume particular order in which Visit methods will be invoked
- Client should be free to invoke methods in any order

 Problem implementing business operations
- Referenced objects are also encapsulating their data
- In order to complete the operation, objects must work together
- Visitor can be used to orchestrate multiple objects into a single operation


SUMMARY OF Calling Protocols and the Visitor
 Alternative implementations of the Visitor design pattern
- It is not necessary to pass the Visitor object to the Accept methods
• It is possible to send a factory method which produces the Visitor object
- It is possible to provide two distinct Accept methods
• One would return void and accept commands
• Another would return an object and accept queries
- Some complicated operations can completely be implemented in the Visitor
• Domain class would then remain simple
 These alternatives are not part of the mainstream literature
